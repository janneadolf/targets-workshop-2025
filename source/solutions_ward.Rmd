# Challenge 1
## Create targets pipeline

To set up the targets pipeline, the following code was used:

```r
use_targets(
  script = here::here("source", "bird_analysis_pipeline", "_targets.R")
)
```

You can run the pipeline with this code:

```{r}
tar_make(
  script = here::here("source", "bird_analysis_pipeline", "_targets.R"),
  store = here::here("source", "bird_analysis_pipeline", "_targets")
)
```
